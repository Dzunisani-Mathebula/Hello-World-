# Hello-World-
This is my first hello world repository, let's do this!

**GitHub repository is a remote repository on GitHub's server.** It is quite obvious since GitHub is a web hosting service for Git repository. 
*One of the major advantages is that you can share your repository just like this article on the internet. It is the easiest and most convenient way.*
One thing I've learned so far is to never ever put ~~credentials~~ on GitHub and other repositories.
